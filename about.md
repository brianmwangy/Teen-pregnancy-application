#### **Introduction** 

##### The gravity of high teenage pregnancy is not new in Kenya. Data from the Demographic and Health Surveys show that almost 2 out of 10 girls between the ages of 15 and 19 are reported to be pregnant or have had a child already. This trend has been fairly consistent for more than two decades with little change in prevalence between 1993 and 2014.

##### Teen pregnancies are a major challenge for socioeconomic development because they deprive our young girls the opportunity to further their education and attain their career goals. It also exposes them and their children to major health risks. According to World Health Organisation, "pregnancy and childbirth complications are the leading cause of death among girls aged 15-19 years globally."

##### It is a really worrying trend to see several young girls pregnant or giving birth while sitting for their Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education and Kenya Certificate of Primary Education examinations.

##### Proven interventions like appropriate sexuality education are also often dismissed with the view that they would encourage young people to indulge in sex. In order to address this challenge decisively, it is important that evidence through data plays a central role in determining interventions that can stump out the problem from its root cause.
